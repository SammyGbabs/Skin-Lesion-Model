# Skin-Lesion-Model

## Project Overview

**Objectives**

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust image classification model that accurately distinguishes between four different skin conditions: Monkeypox, Measles, Chickenpox, and Normal, just by uploading a skin lesion. By leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, the project aims to:

1) Build a Deep Learning Model: Create an effective image classification model utilizing CNN to identify and classify images into the specified categories.
2) Optimize Model Performance: Experiment with various optimization techniques (including Adam and RMSprop), regularization methods (L1 and L2 regularization, dropout), and hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy and minimize loss.
3) Evaluate Model Effectiveness: Assess the model's performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure reliable classification capabilities.
4) Perform Error Analysis: Utilize confusion matrices to visualize and analyze classification errors, helping identify areas for improvement in model performance.
5) Save and Deploy Model: Ensure that the trained model can be easily saved and deployed for future use or further enhancements.
